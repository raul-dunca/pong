# ðŸŽ® Pong
#### This a replica of one of the first computer games ever invented [pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong).
-  This simple "tennis like" game features two paddles and a ball, the goal is to defeat your opponent by being the first one to gain **5 points**, a player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball.
- To play use `W` and `S`.
- While working at this project I created my first "AI" for the **player 2**.
